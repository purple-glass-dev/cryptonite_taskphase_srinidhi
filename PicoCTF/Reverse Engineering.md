From this we can conclude that func1 is just a max function which is comapring the two arguments(2 integers given in  the challenge)
<br/>
After this I compared the maximum number between the numbers given to me in the challenge ==>4112417903 and 1169092511
<br/>
and since 4112417903 is greater, I'll have to find the flag by finding the hex code. 
<br/>
<br/>
So in terminal I first imported `python3`, to get this
```
Python 3.12.6 (main, Sep  6 2024, 19:03:47) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
Showing that I already have it installed on my system. Next to retrieve my hexcode, I wanted to use the `hex()` function which is inbuilt
```
>>> hex(4112417903)
'0xf51e846f'
```
Since the quetion requires me to remove the '0x', my flag will be of the format `picoCTF{f51e846f}`
<br/>
The flag : `picoCTF{f51e846f}`

So in terminal I first imported python3, to get this

```
Python 3.12.6 (main, Sep  6 2024, 19:03:47) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)] on darwin

Showing that I already have it installed on my system. Next to retrieve my hexcode, I wanted to use the hex() function which is inbuilt
```
```
>>> hex(90)
'0x5a'
```
Since the quetion requires me to remove the '0x', my flag will be of the format picoCTF{5a}
To get a 32-bit flag, we will need 8-digits after '0x'
<br/>

The flag : picoCTF{0000005a}

## GDB Baby step-1

The document given in the challenge was a ELF file which I had to somehow reverse engineer to find the value stored in the EAX register(return value of the main function). 
<br/> 
The process started with figuring out how to convert the ELF file into assembly language and I preferred to use Ghidra disassembler to that job.
<br/> 
The installation process on my mac was particulary hard, but after getting through the installation which involved >> Installing Ghidra from Github >> Installing the correct JDK. I was able to upload the file into the Ghidra disassembler.
<br/>
<br/>
Work done in terminal :

```
 ~ % cd Downloads
 Downloads % cd ghidra
 ghidra % ./ghidraRun
```

I was given a detailed file, all converted in assembly language, and then did function>>main, to find my flag next to the EAX register.

<img width="1438" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-17 at 5 28 54 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7a3907f-84c2-4d2e-ae3b-fe8ef9813051" />

Therefore , 0x86342 is the number I was looking for. Converting from hexadecimal to decimal form --
```
 ghidra % python3
Python 3.13.1 (main, Dec  3 2024, 17:59:52) [Clang 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.4)] on darwin

>>> 0x86342
549698
```
The flag : picoCTF{549698}
